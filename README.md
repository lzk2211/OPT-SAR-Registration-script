# OPT-SAR Registration Script

This is a script for registering Optical (OPT) and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images.

## 📁 Directory Structure

1. **Please make sure your files are organized in the following structure before using the script:**

   ```bash
   dataset/
   |
   ├── OPT/     # Folder containing the optical images
   |   ├── tile_0_1024.png
   |   └── tile_0_2048.png
   |
   ├── SAR/     # Folder containing the SAR images
   |   ├── tile_0_1024.png
   |   └── tile_0_2048.png
   |
   ├── Label/   # Output folder for the registration results
   |   ├── tile_0_1024_points.csv
   └── └── tile_0_2048_points.csv
2. **The `csv` file used for registration is automatically generated by a manual labeling script.**

   Before running this script, please ensure that the `Label` folder contains the `.csv` file with manually annotated matching information between OPT and SAR images. This file is essential for the registration process.
